## About

BcdiDocs contains the documentation for a suite of julia packages that solve the BCDI problem. While these packages have their own documentation, that documentation is limited and BcdiDocs contains the full documentation. In general, this package does not need to be edited. BcdiDocs includes the packages it documents as submodules so any changes there will be reflected here after daily updates.
